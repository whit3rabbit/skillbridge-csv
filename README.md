# Skillbridge to CSV

Scrape the DoD SkillBridge Program website into an easier to search CSV.  Much easier to search for requirements that can't easily bee seen on the website without having to click a bunch of expand buttons. Also, allows for visualisations of data.

# How to run

Just run in Google colab and it will save the CSV to your google drive.
